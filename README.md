# BITS-Wifi-on-ESP8266
This code will help you access the internet on your ESP8266 or in fact any other board (Of course, some tweaking will be required).
IMP: This code is specifically designed for my fellow IoT enthusiasts studying in BITS Pilani who are fed up of using their mobile hotspots to get their boards to access the internet and update.
This code's use can also be expanded to university students who may have a captive portal on their network (You just need to change the parameters).
