# BITS-Wifi-on-ESP8266
This code will help you access the internet on your ESP8266 or in fact any other board (Of course, some tweaking will be required). <br/>
This code's use can also be expanded to university students who may have a captive portal on their network (You just need to change the parameters).<br/>

I have attached screenshots of the network tab where you can find your payload and your headers.

**Developer Tab on the Login Page :**
